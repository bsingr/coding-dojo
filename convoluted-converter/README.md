# “The convoluted converter”

A refactoring code kata in JavaScript. Read my corresponding [blog post](https://www.jotaen.net/Kap8E/clean-code-refactoring-kata) for further background.

## Run it

Clone this repo and execute `node test.js` to run all tests or try the program directly, e.g. with `node convr.js -d 0x1f`.

You need NodeJS 10.16.3 (or higher). If you have Docker (19.03.2 or higher), you can also run `make`, which will spawn a container that provides the environment in which you can execute the above commands.
