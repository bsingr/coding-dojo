# The discount campaign

*(From the [code-kata.js](https://github.com/jotaen/code-katas.js) repository)*


## Problem

The owner of a skateboard shop asks you for help: In order to attract more students and pupils to come to her store, she is about to launch a discount campaign. The idea is to offer a rebate for the period of one month. Since she has a pretty much complete set of customer data, she wants to get an overview over the average revenue within the target group, so that she can calculate a proper discount.

## Task

The customer data can be found in the [`data/customer.json`](data/customer.json) file. This is what the data structure looks like:

```
[
  {
    "name": "Rebecca Miller",
    "job": "student",
    "age": 29,
    "orders": [
      {"date": "2015-04-12", "total": 59.99},
      {"date": "2014-12-08", "total": 14.95},
      {"date": "2012-09-26", "total": 102.47}
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```

The conditions for participation for customers are defined as follows:

- The job status of the customer must be one of `student`, `pupil` or `apprentice`
- The age must be 25 or less (the owner does not want to support long term students!)

For the data analysis, all purchases of the calendar year (in this case: 2015) within the target group must be taken into consideration. The shop owner is interested inâ€¦

- the revenue aggregated by months (from January 2015 until December 2015)
- the total revenue throughout the entire year 2015

## Technical constraints

It is **not allowed to use control flow statements** to solve this kata: Do not use `if`, `while`, `for`, `do`, `switch`. (Sidenote: `Array.prototype.forEach()` is okay, though.)

## Solution

My own solution (which is just one possibility to solve this problem) can be found in the [`src/`](src/) folder. Run `npm start` to see the output.
